          <h3>From Python programming to Data Analitcs to Web Development</h3>
          <p>My journey into developing started with an article I read on Medium describing the difference between Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence.
            I wanted to learn how to create my own algorithms and hopefully solve some of humanities most complex problems along the way. Python opened my eyes to the
             magical world of code and I've since gained skills in areas like Data Analytics and Data Visualization which eventually led me to web development, and it's
             here were I definitely feel most at home.</p>

          <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
          <p>Cloud computing is definitely the future, and Google Cloud is a great place for developers to
             not only develop, but also host their applications as well, which is why I decided to get my cloud certification on the GCP platform.
           I'll be hosting sites there very soon. </p>
